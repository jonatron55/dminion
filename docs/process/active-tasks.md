Active tasks
============

This document breaks down current work in progress into smaller tasks. Once a task is complete, check it off the list.
When all active tasks are complete, we can create a log in [completion-logs] folder with learnings and reflections,
reset this list, and review the [backlog].

Objective 1
-----------

***As an engineering team, we have a clearly documented understanding of the project's goals and high-level design
decisions so that we can break down work into key deliverables.***

- [X] Identify core objectives
- [X] Outline key perspectives and features
- [X] Draft project brief
- [X] Update project README with summary and getting started instructions

Objective 2
-----------

***As an engineering team, we have an adaptable and agile process for managing work so that we can execute
efficiently.***

- [X] Create a process document
  - [X] Define how items move from backlog → active tasks → done
  - [X] Establish criteria for moving backlog items to "now" readiness
  - [X] Document when and how to use completion logs
  - [X] Define lightweight review cadence for backlog prioritization
- [X] Break down project brief into manageable backlog items
- [ ] Understand scope of work already done
  - [ ] Audit Rust backend (src-tauri/src) and document implemented features
  - [ ] Review SvelteKit frontend (src/) and map components to perspectives
  - [ ] Document current database schema and data model (if implemented)
  - [ ] Map existing functionality to backlog items (not started, partial, complete)

Working notes
-------------

*Use this section for learnings, discoveries, implementation details, and new work identified during the course of
completing active tasks.*
