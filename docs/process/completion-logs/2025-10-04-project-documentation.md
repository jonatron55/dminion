Project documentation
=====================

**Date completed:** October 4, 2025

Objective
---------

***As an engineering team, we have a clearly documented understanding of the project's goals and high-level design
decisions so that we can break down work into key deliverables.***

Tasks completed
---------------

- [X] Identify core objectives
- [X] Outline key perspectives and features
- [X] Draft project brief
- [X] Update project README with summary and getting started instructions

Learnings
---------

- **Project brief structure**: A concise brief focusing on objectives, perspectives, architecture decisions, and key
  decisions provides sufficient clarity without overspecification. The brief can evolve iteratively.
- **DM vs player separation**: Clearly articulating that this is a DM-only tool (players don't interact with the app)
  eliminates ambiguity about scope and trust model.
- **Documentation as single source of truth**: The project brief serves as the definitive reference, with the README
  providing only a quick overview and link to the brief.
- **Encounter-first priority**: Explicitly prioritizing the encounter perspective helps focus initial development
  efforts and provides a clear north star.

Reflections
-----------

- **Balance achieved**: We found a good balance between providing enough direction for collaborative development and
  avoiding waterfall-style overspecification.
- **Documentation quality**: Following established style guidelines (sentence case, concise language, reference-style
  links) creates professional, scannable documentation.
- **Key decisions section**: Adding a lightweight "Key decisions" section to the brief captures rationale without heavy
  process overhead. This should help future contributors understand "why" without archaeology.
