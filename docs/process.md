Development process
===================

Overview
--------

We use a lightweight, agile process built around three documents:

- **[Backlog]**: High-level objectives prioritized by readiness and importance.
- **[Active tasks]**: Current work broken into actionable tasks.
- **[Completion logs]**: Record of finished objectives with learnings.

Workflow
--------

1. **Select work**: Choose "now/high" items from the backlog (see [task breakdown]).
2. **Break down**: Add objectives to active tasks with specific, actionable sub-tasks.
3. **Execute**: Complete tasks, capture notes and discoveries as you work.
4. **Finish**: Create completion logs, update backlog, reset for next objective (see [objective completion]).

Key principles
--------------

- Keep backlog items high-level; detailed breakdown happens in active tasks only.
- Review and update backlog regularly as priorities shift.
- Completion logs preserve context and learnings for future reference.
- Process is meant to enable work, not create overhead.
