Task breakdown instructions
============================

Follow these steps to move backlog items into active work:

1. **Discuss which backlog items to activate.**
   - Review the "To do" section in `backlog.md`.
   - Consider current priorities, dependencies, and team capacity.
   - Select one or more items marked "now" readiness with "high" priority first.
   - Ensure selected items align with current objectives or represent new objectives worth pursuing.
   - Discuss any dependencies between items (e.g., data model must exist before encounter tracking).

2. **Create objective sections in `active-tasks.md`.**
   - Add a new "Objective N" section for each backlog item being activated.
   - Copy the full objective statement from the backlog as the section heading (in bold/italic).
   - Number objectives sequentially (Objective 3, Objective 4, etc.).

3. **Break down each objective into specific tasks.**
   - Under each objective section, create a checkbox list of concrete, actionable tasks.
   - Keep tasks small enough to complete in a reasonable work session.
   - Order tasks logically (prerequisites first, dependencies clear).
   - Use sub-checkboxes (indented) for multi-step tasks when helpful.
   - Ensure each task has a clear definition of done.

4. **Update the "Doing" section in `backlog.md`.**
   - Add the activated objective(s) to the bullet list under "Doing".
   - Keep the full objective statement for clarity.
   - Maintain the reference link to `[active tasks]` at the bottom.

5. **Update the "To do" section in `backlog.md`.**
   - Remove the activated objective(s) from the table.
   - Do not delete the rows entirely; move them to "Doing" first.
   - Keep the table properly formatted with remaining items.

6. **Review the breakdown for completeness.**
   - Verify that completing all tasks under an objective would satisfy the objective statement.
   - Check for missing steps, unclear tasks, or hidden dependencies.
   - Ensure the breakdown remains tactical and actionable, not overly detailed.
   - Confirm that someone new to the project could understand what to do.

7. **Capture context in working notes if needed.**
   - Use the "Working notes" section in `active-tasks.md` for discoveries or context.
   - Document key decisions, open questions, or implementation approaches.
   - Keep notes concise and relevant to active work.
